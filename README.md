Welcome! 

In this program you can test four different algorithms, Heap Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort and Qsort. 

In case you missed the Makefile you will find instructions of how to compile below :|
                                                                                    V
                                gcc -Wall  main.c heapsort.c selection_sort.c array_factory.c -o sort_calculator.exe

Before sorting please create an array, random, sorted, reversed or almost sorted. 
All the alternatives can be found in the main menu. 

When you have created an array you are ready to go sort with your preferred choice of algorithm. 

The time it took to sort the array will be displayed on the screen. 


Enjoy
